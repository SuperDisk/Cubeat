Literals can be

vgm_literals (normal)
vgm_literals2 (switch to next port, or quit if on port 0)

Phrase references can be

<..some dict phrase address..>
  - normal, just references a dict entry

<.. some dict phrase address..> BUT it's a giant jump table in ROM0
  - all just jumps to the same code
  - grabs the actual phrase from the stack
  - changes port if port is 1 and continues OR
  - restores stack to normal, `call HL`.
